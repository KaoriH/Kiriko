        <p>Japanese glassware might not be well known in
          the United States compared
          with European glass. <strong>Kiriko</strong> is a
          tradition of cut glass, or beautiful
          Japanese craftsmanship. It looks similar to
          Eurpean glass, but has distinctive
          differences as explained below. I hope that
          Kiriko will bring new awareness
          into your lives.</p>

        <h3 id="history">History</h3>
        <p>Glass making has started more than 4,000 years
          ago in Mesopotamia, now
          Iraq and northern Syria, while in Japan, glass
          has been around for about
          2,000 years. Glassware was first introduced to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Din">the
            Shosoin</a> treasure house in the old capital
          Nara from Persia in the 6th century.
          It was not until the middle of the 16th century
          that European glass arrived
          in Japan. The Jesuit missionary
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Xavier">
            Francis Xavier
          </a> presented items made of glass including eye
          glasses
          as gifts for Japan's feudal lords in 1550. Under
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate">the
            Edo Shogunate</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>
          was the
          only gateway to the world, where the glassmaking
          was introduced from
          China.

        <p>It was in the 19th century that glass cutting
          was introduced to Japan.
          After the 18th century, European cut glassware
          was imported by Dutch
          ships. Since then, the glass was called <em>giyaman</em>.
          The name originates
          from the Portuguese "Diamante" because of the
          shininess of the cut facets.
          Therefore, being attracted to the beautiful
          <em>giyaman</em>, the Japanese developed thicker
          glass to cut patterns
          well and learn the technique. During the Edo
          period, the use of glass
          was becoming more widespread. The beauty of
          delicate translucent colored
          glass was even compared to beautiful women.

        <p>Compared with the imported European glass,
          Kiriko has soft edge quality
          because the cuts are more rounded and made by
          hand rather than with machines.
          The Japanese learned designs from Europe, so they
          initially made th3
          same patterns. But getting a hint from textile
          fabrics, they later incorporated
          their own patterns. Their originality and
          imagination was condensed in
          rich variations.

          The charm of Kiriko stands out when it is made of
          high-quality glass. Longing for
          European cut glass with the sparkle of diamond,
          glass workers in Osaka,
          Kyoto, Edo, and Satsuma went through great
          efforts to improve the basic
          materials themselves. The basic materials of
          Japanese glass are essentially
          bluish, greenish, or yellowish due to iron
          impurities. When comparing
          the cut glass from the advertisement of the
          Kagaya wholesaler in Edo
          with existing antique Kiriko, apparently clear
          cut glass with one or
          two patterns was mainstream. One of the reasons
          was the difficulty of
          making colored overlay, but above all, the fact
          that "clear" glass was
          probably more popular. This is emphasized in the
          expression of the Edo
          spirit by the brilliant radiance achieved through
          infinite repetition
          of simple cut patterns. The distinguishing mark
          of Edo kiriko is the
          smoothness of the cuts as if it is coated with
          oil. Having said that,
          nowadays, you can see more colored glass of Edo
          kiriko.</p>

        <p>On the other hand,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satsuma_Domain">
            the Satsuma domain</a> manufactured Satsuma
          Kiriko and developed "irokise (cased glass)" at
          the end of the Edo period. The glass making that
          had started in 1846
          by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimazu_Narioki">
            Shimazu Narioki </a>who
          invited glass workers from Kagaya in Edo to make
          medicine bottles changed
          direction when Shimazu Nariakira started creation
          of art work which included
          a view of overseas exports. At the end of the
          year 1851, they were successfully
          making cased crimson glass to the prestige of the
          domain. Unlike the
          clear Edo Kiriko, Satsuma Kiriko has a colorful
          range such as indigo
          blue, crimson, purple, verdigris, green, and
          yellow like olive. Kiriko
          entertains a combination of various patterns and
          the contrast of clear
          glass covered with colored glass. The most
          important features of Satsuma
          Kiriko is the gradation in colors called the
          "Bokashi" effect, subtle
          shadings of color.

        <p>The early 20th century saw Western influences
          spread into Japan through
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco">the
            Art Deco</a> movement.
          Kiriko was also affected by variety of designs
          but kept its own gentle
          aesthetic of Edo. These days Japanese traditional
          craftsmanships of Kiriko
          been applied to modern design and technology.
          Kiriko keeps in step with
          the times...
